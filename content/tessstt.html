          <p>Since this is a software-based project, there are, of course, no upfront costs. In fact, spending time
            coding might even be worth it because of the learning outcomes. The time is well spent, even if there isn't
            much of a direction yet. In parallel, the plan is to figure out what might be needed in the "real world"
            market and what already exists concurrently.</p>

          <h4 class="font-bold">Development of a relational database</h4>
          <p>
            After some brainstorming, research, trial and error, the project has landed on building a relational
            database. This is ideal for the simulation projects because it efficiently manages structured data and
            complex relationships. It ensures data integrity through constraints, supports scalability, and allows
            powerful querying with SQL.
