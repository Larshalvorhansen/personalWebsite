      driving this project along with a project timeline.<br></h2>
    <br>
    <!-- <p>
      Throughout human history, we have made remarkable progress in solving analytical problems. For example, in 1977,
      we successfully calculated the precise trajectories for Voyager 1 and 2, ensuring their successful journeys
      through space. Similarly, we have built increasingly more advanced architecture thanks to the continual progress
      of material science, CAD software and general physics. However, while these endeavors are intricate and require
      detailed calculations, they aren't truly complex.
    </p> -->
    <br>
    <p>
      Complexity arises when there are nonlinear relationships, feedback loops, and unstable dynamics. Examples range
      from predicting traffic jams in a bustling city to understanding how the weather will unfold based solely on
      initial conditions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we can make significant progress in predicting complex systems by breaking down the system into
      smaller components often called agents. These agents follow a simpler set of rules regarding how they act with
      their environment. This approach allows us to iteratively simulate the behavior of the entire system. By trying
      different values for the variables that we can change in real-world scenarios within the simulation, we gain
      valuable insights about how the system as a whole will be affected. As a consequence, this insight enables us to
      make better, more informed decisions in the real world.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In science, testing a hypothesis is crucial for proving or disproving a theory. However, in economics, especially
      on large scales, it is both analytically unpredictable and often very costly or impossible to test new government
      policies, such as those listed here, before analyzing their real-world implementation results and aftereffects.
      Additionally, in democratic governments, where new politicians are elected every four years, a policy might be
      reversed before any meaningful impact, positive or negative, can be measured.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      This is the problem that Lambdasim aims to tackle. By creating detailed and dynamic models of economic systems,
      simulations can predict the potential outcomes of various policies without the need for real-world implementation.
      These simulations can account for numerous variables and their interactions, providing a more comprehensive
      analysis of possible results. This approach allows policymakers to evaluate the potential impacts of their
      decisions in a controlled environment, reducing the risks, costs, and ambiguities associated with trial-and-error
      in real-world policy testing.
