# Predicting the outcomes of this years G20 summit.

This weeks article migth seem like an impossible feat.

With the world Nations being highly complex, mutlifacited with both puclic and hidden agendas, as well as having vastly different geography, natural resources, degree of humandevelopement(education, infrastructure and institutions in general), trading partners, culture, demography and history.

Nevertheless, the outcome of trying to predict each country and country coalitions of the G20 summit will at best be of high strategic value and at worst be completly wrong, but still very edicational.

Since this is quite a large topic this weeks post will be the first of a four week series trying to predict the G20 summit outcomes.

So lets start this week by breaking down the categories of initial variables for the meeting:

- Countries(+ the EU) atttending
  Demography:

  Specific for democracies attending:

  - Leading political party stance on every potical issue[array of ratios]
  - Degree of allignment between country leader and her/his party[ratio]
  - Political influence/power of political leader [ratio]

- Enviroment
  - Ongoing wars
    - Countries involved [list of countries]
    - Scale/severity [ratio]
    - Aid recieved [list of integers representing millions of dollars recieved]
  - Recent(upto 1 year) natural disasters
    - Countries affected [list]
    - People affected [integer]
    - Scale/severity [ratio]
    - Aid recieved [list of integers representing millions of dollars recieved]
  - Global agregate support/attention to various political issues
    - Feminism [ratio]
    - Global warming
      - Climate related
      - Biodiversity related
    - lgbt+ rigths [ratio]
    - rigth to luxury [ratio]
    - Animal rigths

Disclamers about these variables:
As with many things, when there are many variables involved they tend to be of massivly different imprtant. Often times the five most important variables explain 90% of the outcome. I am assuming this phenomenon to be true here aswell allthough further efforts could be done in order to prove/disprove this fact. Nevertheless each variable will be weighted somehow.
