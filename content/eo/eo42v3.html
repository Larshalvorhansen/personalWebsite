  To understand complex systems like the global economy, it’s helpful to
  approach them from multiple perspectives. One can analyze economies from a
  bottom-up perspective, starting with individual industries, or take a top-down
  view, treating countries or even the entire world as single entities competing
  and cooperating for resources. This week’s article adopts a global
  perspective, exploring the most prominent industries across countries and U.S.
  states.

  The structure of global trade is well-documented by organizations like the
  OECD. Their trade database provides a clear view of global economic flows [1].
  However, imports and exports alone don’t tell the full story, as many products
  and services are produced and consumed domestically within a country.

  According to a comprehensive study by OnDeck, manufacturing remains the
  dominant industry in 52 of 96 major economies, based on LinkedIn data
  analyzing over 82 million businesses [2]. Taiwan leads with 16.6% of its
  companies in manufacturing, driven by its $150 billion semiconductor industry,
  which produces 60% of the world’s chips. India follows closely, with 13.6% of
  its companies in manufacturing, bolstered by its steel and automotive sectors,
  aiming to increase manufacturing’s share of GDP to 25% by 2025.

  What are the benefits of global trade? The classic theory of comparative
  advantage suggests that countries specialize in producing goods and services
  where they are most efficient, trading to mutual benefit. For instance,
  Luxembourg generates 31% of its GDP from financial services, while Argentina
  and other South American countries see rapid growth in advertising, with
  Argentina’s ad market growing 116% in 2022 [2].

  Is globalization slowing? Interestingly, we are witnessing a counterintuitive
  trend toward a less globalized world, driven by protectionism and supply chain
  disruptions. A 2023 McKinsey report discusses how global trade faces
  challenges from geopolitical tensions and regionalization efforts, potentially
  reshaping economic dynamics [3].
