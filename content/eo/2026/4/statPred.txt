This years G7 meeting, comically postponed from the 15th to the 17th of June by Macron as Trump dobble booked himself to a WWE wrestling match(Hard to beleave?). It is said to be quite exiting and important, especially as the relations between these 7 ww2-winning seem to be at a tipping point.

Woudnt it be fun to look into a crystal ball too see how the extremely complex phenomenon that is global politics. Governments, personalities, soscietal happenings, assymetric information and external facotrs leading up to this event migth predict the outcome of this meeting.

As a fun exersice: lets do exactly that. Lets make an agent based simulation(qiqi insert wikipedia link on that and write [ABM]) from now on.

last week of every month
Jan - Announcement
Feb - Aspect a of the meeting (Personal?)
March - Aspect b of the meeting (Geopolitical)
April - aspect c
May - combining it all
June - combining it all
July - Evaluation

This will be a series of articles  

Prediction: 
As of now before we begin simulating anything my gut feeling would be that the US pushes its zero-sum imperial politics, 
France, Italy, Germany, the UK and Canada push for larger economic collaboration in uncertain times amongst all the G7 countries, And Japan raises concerns over China-Taiwan dispute.
