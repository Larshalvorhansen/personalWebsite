    <h1>Personal Economic Outlook - PCA Analysis</h1>

    <p>
      Turns out doing a good PCA analysis was harder than I thought. So this
      week I'll be writing a more personal version of the economic outlook.
    </p>

    <h2>Deadlines and Expectations</h2>

    <p>
      We all have, or at least speaking for myself, I often have unrealistic and
      idealistic expectations for myself. And from experience I know that I
      won't reach them 100%, but this is also fine because I know that getting
      10% of the way to the moon is still a pretty good HEO (Highly Elliptical
      Orbit) around earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is always only one true way of knowing what will happen in the
      future and that is simply by extrapolation, either in a detailed
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"
        >Monte Carlo simulation</a
      >
      or in real time by just simply waiting, obviously.
    </p>

    <h2>Prediction</h2>

    <p>
      Despite this, I predict that next week will be a good presentation of a
      PCA analysis showing the explained variance and principal components of
      the 500 biggest publicly listed Norwegian companies.
    </p>

    <p>
      PCA is not a commonly known thing so I'll explain it here for readers next
      week. It is really worth knowing about because it is a really good way to
      make sense of high dimensional data.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What do I know about high dimensional data? Nothing in my life is ever
      more than 3-dimensional," you might be thinking for yourself at first.
      However, let me give you an example of a highly dimensional dataset you
      already know or have a feeling of many pieces of: The set of all world
      countries and their corresponding attributes such as latitude, longitude,
      GDP, population, climate, standard of living, employment rate, life
      expectancy, and many more.
    </p>

    <p>In a table form it would look something like this:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Country</th>
        <th>Population (millions)</th>
        <th>GDP per capita ($)</th>
        <th>Employment Rate (%)</th>
        <th>Life Expectancy (years)</th>
      </tr>

      </tr>

      </tr>

      </tr>

        <td>12,500</td>

        <td>78</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Spain</td>
        <td>48</td>
        <td>30,500</td>
        <td>67.0</td>
        <td>84</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bhutan</td>
        <td>0.8</td>
        <td>3,400</td>
        <td>65.0</td>
        <td>72</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Singapore</td>
        <td>5.9</td>
        <td>90,674</td>

        <td>84</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      How would we plot these? We could do one plot of population on the x-axis
      and GDP on the other, or maybe even make a 3D plot of population on x, GDP
      on y, and climate on z. This way we can see if there are relationships
      between these factors, such as the fact that high populations correlate
      with GDP to a certain degree because we seem to have a row of countries in
      a certain line.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, what if we wanted to just look at all of them at once?
      Unfortunately we can't. We would need an x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and many
      more axes. No one can comprehend so many dimensions at once. However, we
      can project them using some clever linear algebra with regards to
      eigenvectors and eigenvalues. You can read more if you are curious here.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding PCA Through Projection</h2>

    <p>
      Anyhow, if you don't want to dive into the mathematics, you can think of
      projecting 3 dimensions onto 2 dimensions like this: Imagine you have a
      child's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery">orrery</a> toy (a
      mechanical model of the solar system with planets that orbit around a
      central sun). Then you have a lamp in the room that casts a shadow from
      the 3D toy onto the wall. This is how we can think of projecting a higher
      dimension (3 in this case) onto a 2-dimensional plane.
    </p>

    Ill have an image here
    <p>
      But remember, we can still choose where to place the lamp. So to make
      things less arbitrary and more meaningful, for each dimension we reduce,
      we choose the angle that maximizes the spread of the objects on the wall.
      In this case with the orrery of the solar system, that would be somewhere
      from the side where all the planets are on roughly the same plane.
    </p>

    <h2>Principal Components and Explained Variance</h2>

    <p>
      In PCA analysis, we create new axes called principal components (PC1, PC2,
      PC3, etc.). PC1 is the direction that captures the most variance in the
      data. PC2 captures the second most variance and is perpendicular to PC1,
      and so on. The explained variance tells us how much of the total variation
      in our data is captured by each principal component.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if PC1 has 45% explained variance, it means that this single
      axis captures 45% of all the variation in our multi-dimensional dataset.
      If PC2 has 25% explained variance, then together PC1 and PC2 capture 70%
      of the variation. This allows us to reduce many dimensions down to just 2
      or 3 that we can actually visualize and understand, while still retaining
      most of the important information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next week, I'll present the full PCA analysis of the 500 largest publicly
      listed Norwegian companies, showing which financial metrics drive the most
      variance in company performance and how companies cluster together in this
      reduced dimensional space.
