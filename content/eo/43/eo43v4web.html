        A PCA Analysis of Norway's 500 Largest Companies in 2025
      </h2>
      <small class="post-date">Week 43</small>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>
          This report presents a principal component analysis (PCA) examining
          the geographic, sectoral, and financial characteristics of Norway's
          500 largest companies. In brief, the analysis reveals that nearly all
          the variance (85.8%) is explained by just the first three principal
          components (PC1, 2 and 3), indicating that large Norwegian firms are
          highly similar and follow predictable patterns. The dominant drivers
          explaining their differences are economic sector (primary, secondary,
          or tertiary), profitability, and thirdly, the company age.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The dataset comprises 495 Norwegian companies (after data cleaning)
          and 17 features: financial metrics (revenue, assets, equity,
          profitability ratio, ROA, ROE, profit margin, asset turnover), company
          characteristics (age, employee count, profitability status),
          geographic data (distance from Oslo), and sector classification
          (primary, secondary, tertiary). Missing data (34%) was imputed using
          mean values, and all features were normalized to a [0,1] range using
          min-max scaling before PCA was performed.

        <br />
        <p>
          As visible in the scree plot, these three principal components explain
          almost all of the variance: PC1 captures 45.3%, PC2 adds 28.8%, and
          PC3 contributes 11.7%. Since the first three components capture so
          much of the variance, large Norwegian companies cluster into distinct,
          behaviorally similar groups. The dimensionality reduction from 17 to 3
          dimensions is highly efficient, allowing for clear visualization in
          three-dimensional space.

            >PC1 (45.3%): Economic Sector and Profitability Divide:</strong
          >
          From the PCA loadings chart, the three strongest contributors to PC1
          are profitability (+0.63), secondary sector score (+0.46), and
          tertiary sector score (-0.61). Thus, PC1 captures the major divide
          between profitable secondary-sector firms (industry, construction,
          manufacturing) on the positive side and tertiary-sector firms
          (services, finance, trade) on the negative side. The single strongest
          predictor of a company's other traits is whether it operates in goods
          production (secondary) or services (tertiary).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>PC2 (28.8%): Company Maturity and Establishment:</strong>
          Company age impacts PC2 strongly at +0.61. The three sector indicators
          from PC1 also remain influential, confirming their importance. Older,
          established tertiary firms (such as DNB and Telenor) stand apart from
          newer secondary-sector firms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>PC3 (11.7%): Primary Sector and Proximity to Oslo:</strong>
          After PC1 and PC2 extract their variance, the remaining dominant
          signal distinguishes primary-sector firms and headquarters distance
          from Oslo. This aligns with intuition: large Norwegian companies
          typically headquarter in the capital, while primary-sector firms
          (resource extraction) are located far from Oslo, often offshore (oil
          platforms), along the coast (wild fishing, aquaculture), or near
          hydropower sites (e.g., Norsk Hydro).

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The biplot is useful for visualizing correlations between companies
          (points) and features (arrows). Small angles indicate high positive
          correlation; approximately 90° means no correlation. In our biplot,
          profitability correlates strongly with both sector type and company
          age. Most large Norwegian firms cluster tightly, suggesting high
          similarity across dimensions. However, imputing 34% missing data with
          averages have most likely artificially tightened the clusters. Future
          analyses would benefit from more complete data collection.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Key Insights:</strong> The primary sector is small but
          dominated by Equinor (~70% of total primary-sector by market cap). The
          secondary sector shows wide performance dispersion: successes like
          Kongsberg Gruppen coexist with struggling players like REC Silicon.
          The tertiary (services) sector dominates in company count, firms like
          DNB and Telenor being in the lead. A firms age intrestingly correlates
          positively with profits, especially in Norway's services sector.
          Established players like Storebrand enjoy structural advantages over
          newcomers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Primary-sector firms are located farthest from Oslo, tied to resource
          geography. Secondary and tertiary firms cluster around Oslo (and
          secondarily Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger), though only Oslo distance
          was modeled here. Size metrics cluster tightly, suggesting that
          Norwegian firms maybe follow similar asset allocation patterns,
          possibly driven by strict taxation incentivizing efficient capital
          use. But that is only speculation and would be interesting to
          reserearch further in the future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>In conclusion:</strong> Norway's corporate landscape is
          remarkably homogeneous along these three core axes: sector,
          profitability, and age, with geography playing a fourth and intuitive
          role. The extreme concentration of variance in just three components
          could underscore the structural uniformity among Norway's largest
          firms, that could be shaped by shared resource dependence (especially
          on oil), a mature service industry, strict government regulation and a
          natural clustering in financial metrics related to company size.
