            A PCA Analysis of Norway's 500 Largest Companies in 2025
          </h2>
          <small class="post-date">Week 43</small>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              This report presents a principal component analysis (PCA)
              examining the geographic, sectoral, and financial characteristics
              of Norway's 500 largest companies. In brief, the analysis reveals
              that nearly all the variance (85.8%) is explained by just the
              first three principal components (PC1, 2 and 3), indicating that
              Norwegian large firms are highly similar and follow predictable
              patterns. The dominant drivers explaining their differences are
              economic sector (primary, secondary, or tertiary), profitability,
              and thirdly, the company age.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The dataset comprises 495 Norwegian companies (after data
              cleaning) and 17 features: financial metrics (revenue, assets,
              equity, profitability ratio, ROA, ROE, profit margin, asset
              turnover), company characteristics (age, employee count,
              profitability status), geographic data (distance from Oslo), and
              sector classification (primary, secondary, tertiary). Missing data
              (34%) was imputed using mean values, and all features were
              normalized to a [0,1] range using min-max scaling before PCA was
              performed.
            </p>

              variance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As visible in the scree plot, these three principal components
              explain almost all of the variance: PC1 captures 45.3%, PC2 adds
              28.8%, and PC3 contributes 11.7%. Since the first three components
              capture so much of the variance, large Norwegian companies cluster
              into distinct, behaviorally similar groups. The dimensionality
              reduction from 17 to 3 dimensions is highly efficient, allowing
              for clear visualization in three-dimensional space.

                >PC1 (45.3%) – Economic Sector and Profitability Divide:</strong
              >
              From the PCA loadings chart, the three strongest contributors to
              PC1 are profitability (+0.63), secondary sector score (+0.46), and
              tertiary sector score (-0.61). Thus, PC1 captures the major divide
              between profitable secondary-sector firms (industry, construction,
              manufacturing) on the positive side and tertiary-sector firms
              (services, finance, trade) on the negative side. The single
              strongest predictor of a company's other traits is whether it
              operates in goods production (secondary) or services (tertiary).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>PC2 (28.8%) – Company Maturity and Establishment:</strong>
              Company age loads strongly at +0.61. The three sector indicators
              from PC1 also remain influential, confirming their overarching
              importance. Older, established tertiary firms (e.g., DNB, Telenor)
              stand apart from newer secondary-sector firms (e.g., Aker
              Solutions, Kongsberg Gruppen).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong
                >PC3 (11.7%) – Primary Sector and Proximity to Oslo:</strong
              >
              After PC1 and PC2 extract their variance, the remaining dominant
              signal distinguishes primary-sector firms and headquarters
              distance from Oslo. This aligns with intuition: large Norwegian
              companies typically headquarter in the capital, while
              primary-sector firms (resource extraction) are located far from
              Oslo, often offshore (oil platforms), along the coast (wild
              fishing, aquaculture), or near hydropower sites (e.g., Norsk
              Hydro).
            </p>

            <img
              src="https://halvorhansen.no/imageDB/43images/biplot.png"
              alt="PCA Biplot (PC1 vs PC2)"
              class="post-image"

            <p class="image-caption">
              PCA Biplot (PC1 vs PC2). Arrow length reflects feature importance;
              point clusters show company similarity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The biplot is useful for visualizing correlations between
              companies (points) and features (arrows). Small angles indicate
              high positive correlation; approximately 90° means no correlation.
              In our biplot, profitability correlates strongly with both sector
              type and company age. Most large Norwegian firms cluster tightly,
              suggesting high similarity across dimensions. However, imputing
              34% missing data with averages may have artificially tightened
              clusters. Future analyses would benefit from more complete data
              collection.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Key Insights:</strong> The primary sector is small but
              dominated by Equinor (~70% of total primary-sector by market cap).
              The secondary sector shows wide performance dispersion: successes
              like Kongsberg Gruppen coexist with struggling players like REC
              Silicon. The tertiary (services) sector dominates in company
              count, firms like DNB, Telenor, and Yara International lead. Firm
              age correlates positively with profits, especially in services.
              Established players like DNB and Storebrand enjoy structural
              advantages over newcomers like Kahoot! or Nordic Semiconductor.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Primary-sector firms are located farthest from Oslo, tied to
              resource geography. Secondary and tertiary firms cluster around
              Oslo (and secondarily Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger), though only
              Oslo distance was modeled here. Size metrics cluster tightly,
              suggesting Norwegian firms follow similar asset allocation
              patterns, possibly driven by strict taxation incentivizing
              efficient capital use.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>In conclusion:</strong> Norway's corporate landscape is
              remarkably homogeneous along three core axes, sector,
              profitability, and age, with geography playing a secondary but
              intuitive role. The extreme concentration of variance in just
              three components underscores structural uniformity among the
              country's largest firms, shaped by resource dependence, mature
              service incumbents, and capital-centric clustering.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Interesting topics for further analysis include:</strong>
              causes of the link between company age and profitability in
              Norway's tertiary sectors, impact of taxation on asset allocation
              homogeneity, inclusion of regional city distances (Bergen,
              Stavanger, etc.) in future geographic models, robustness checks
              using alternative imputation methods (e.g.,
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm"
                target="_blank"
                >KNN</a
              >, iterative imputation), and sector-specific PCA to uncover
              sub-patterns within secondary heterogeneity.
