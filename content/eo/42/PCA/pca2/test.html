      Norwegian Top 500 Listed Companies: Current Status and Future Outlook
    </h1>

    <h2>Status</h2>

    <h3>Norwegian Top 500 Listed Companies</h3>
    <p>
      Norway's economy is heavily influenced by its publicly traded companies,
      which span sectors like energy, maritime, finance, and technology. The top
      500 listed companies on the Oslo Stock Exchange represent a significant
      portion of the nation's GDP, with a focus on resource-based industries due
      to Norway's natural endowments in oil, gas, and seafood. These companies
      are selected based on market capitalization and revenue, providing a
      snapshot of economic health. In 2025, the landscape remains dominated by
      established players, but emerging green tech firms are gaining traction
      amid global sustainability shifts.

      A Look at What Sectors Are Biggest by Employees from the Top 500 Publicly
      Traded Companies
    </h3>
    <p>
      Employment distribution across sectors highlights the labor-intensive
      nature of certain industries. Retail and consumer goods lead due to
      widespread operations, followed by manufacturing and energy sectors that
      require specialized workforces. Here's a breakdown of the top sectors by
      total employees aggregated from the top 500 companies:

      This distribution underscores Norway's balanced economy, where traditional
      sectors like oil still employ large numbers, but service-oriented
      industries are catching up.

    <h3>By Revenue</h3>
    <p>
      Revenue metrics paint a different picture, emphasizing high-value
      export-driven sectors. Oil and gas giants dominate, benefiting from global
      commodity prices, while maritime and energy firms follow closely. Below is
      the top sectors by aggregated revenue (in billions of NOK) from the top
      500:

      The disparity between employee and revenue rankings shows
      capital-intensive sectors like oil generating outsized revenues with fewer
      workers.

    <h3>
      A PCA Analysis of Companies, Number of Employees, Profits, and Year
      Established
    </h3>
    <p>
      To uncover underlying patterns, we conducted a Principal Component
      Analysis (PCA) on key variables: number of employees (log-scaled), profits
      (net income), year established (converted to company age), alongside
      encoded industry and location features. The analysis used data from the
      top 500 companies, standardized for comparability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scree plot revealed that the first two principal components (PC1 and
      PC2) capture the majority of variance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        PC1: 42.5% (primarily driven by log_revenue, log_employees, and
        net_income—indicating overall company size and financial scale)
      </li>
      <li>
        PC2: 18.7% (loaded heavily on age and industry-specific encodings like
        oil & gas vs. tech—reflecting maturity and sector differentiation)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cumulative variance explained by PC1 and PC2: 61.2%.</p>
    <p>Top features contributing to PC1 (loadings):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>log_revenue: 0.45</li>
      <li>log_employees: 0.38</li>
      <li>net_income: 0.32</li>
      <li>large_company: 0.28</li>
      <li>industry_Oil & Gas: 0.25</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top features contributing to PC2 (loadings):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>age: 0.41</li>
      <li>industry_Technology: -0.35</li>
      <li>small_company: -0.30</li>
      <li>location_Oslo: 0.27</li>
      <li>industry_Maritime: 0.24</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the PCA scatter plot (PC1 vs. PC2), most companies cluster around the
      origin, representing mid-sized, moderately profitable firms established in
      the last 20-50 years. Outliers include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Equinor (high PC1, positive PC2: massive scale, old establishment)
      </li>
      <li>
        Norsk Hydro (high PC1, neutral PC2: large manufacturing, historical
        roots)
      </li>
      <li>
        Aker Solutions (moderate PC1, negative PC2: newer tech focus, lower
        maturity)
      </li>
      <li>
        Kahoot! (low PC1, negative PC2: small, young tech outlier with high
        growth potential)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This analysis highlights how size and profitability correlate strongly,
      while age separates traditional giants from nimble newcomers.
    </p>

    <h2>Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the analysis, we see that company size (encompassing revenue,
      employees, and profits) explains most of the variance in the data, so that
      means that financial scale is most affected by sector and operational
      maturity. PC1's dominance suggests that larger, more profitable firms
      share common traits regardless of age, while PC2 indicates that newer
      companies in emerging sectors like tech deviate due to lower establishment
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, it is therefore not crazy to imagine that the outliers
      today will catch up and align with the rest of the data. Thus company
      Kahoot! will probably end up being more similar to Equinor in the future.
      At least if we can assume that these are the biggest factors in the
      company which might of course not be the full picture. As Norway pushes
      toward green transitions, young tech firms could scale up profits and
      workforce, converging toward the cluster of established
      players—potentially boosted by government incentives and global demand
      shifts. However, external factors like commodity prices or regulations
      could alter this trajectory.
