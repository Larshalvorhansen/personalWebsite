Turns out doing a good PCA analysis was harder than I though. 

So this week Ill be writing a more personal version of the economic outlook.

Deadlines and expectations.

We all have, or atleast speaking for myself: I often have unrealistic and idealistic expectaions for myself. 

And from experience i know that i wont reach them 100%. but this is I am also fine with because i know that that getting 10% of the way to the moon is still a pretty good HEO(Highly eliptical orbit) around earth. 

There is allways only one tre way of knowing what will happen in the future and that is siimply by extrapolation. eithre in a detailed montecaro simulation or in real time by just simply waiting. ...(obvciusly)

Prediction:
Despite this i predict that next week will be a good presentation of a pca analysis the explained variance.. ?... qiqiqi of the 500 bigbgest publily listedc norwegian companies. 

PCA is not a commonly know thing so ill explain it here for readers next week. 
It is really worth knowing about because it is a really good way to make sence of high dimentional data. 
"What do i know about "high dimentional data". Nothing in my life is ever bore than 3Dimentional. " you migth be thinking for yourself at first. 

however let me give you an example a of highly  dimentinoal dataset you allready know or have a feeling of many peces of: The set of all world countres and their corresponding atributes such as latitude, longditude, gdp, population, climate, standard of living, employmnent rate, etc qiqiqi, ... . 

in a table form it would look somehting like this: 
qiqiqi
usa
norway
uk
south africa  
lesoto
costa rica
spain
buthan
singapore

how would we plot these? we could do one plot of population on x axit and gdp on the other. or maybe even make a 3d plot of population on x, gdp on y and climate on z. thsi way we can se if there are relationships between these  favctors such as the fact that high populations corelate with gdp to a certain deegree because we seem to have a row of countres in a certan line. 

Howevber what if we wanted to just look at all of them at once? Un fotanualyt we cant. we would need an x axis, y axis, z axis, æ axis, ø axis, å axis etc etc. noone can comprehend so many dimentions at once. however we can project them using some clever linear algebra w regards to lambdafunctions and eigenvalues etc(embedded wiki links) you can read more if you are curius here. anyhow if you dont want to dive into the mathematics: you can think of projecting 3 dimentins on to 2 dimentions like this: 

imagine you have a childs planet toy thingy whnat swthat called? qiqiqi. then you have a lamp in the room that casts a shadow from the 3d toy onto the wall. This is how we can think of projecting a higher dimention(3 in this case) onto a 2 dimentianl plane. 

but remember we can still choose werhe to place the lamp. so to make things less arbitreaty and more meaningful, for each dimeintion we reduce we chooose the angle that mimimizes the spread of the objects on the wall. in this case with the planet toy of the kid that would be somewhere where form the side where all the planets are on roughly  the same plane. 

qiqiqi contiuation about the qiqiqi pca 1, 2, 3 etc and exsplained varieance etc
