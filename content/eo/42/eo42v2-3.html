              Turns out doing a good PCA analysis was harder than I thought. So
              this week I'll be writing a more personal version of the economic

              Deadlines and Expectations
            </h3>
            <p>
              We all have, or at least speaking for myself, I often have
              unrealistic and idealistic expectations for myself. And from
              experience I know that I won't reach them 100%, but this is also
              fine because I know that getting 10% of the way to the moon is
              still a pretty good HEO (Highly Elliptical Orbit) around earth.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is always only one true way of knowing what will happen in
              the future and that is simply by extrapolation, either in a
              detailed
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"
                >Monte Carlo simulation</a
              >
              or in real time by just simply waiting, obviously.

              Prediction
            </h3>
            <p>
              Despite this, I predict that next week will be a good presentation
              of a PCA analysis showing the explained variance and principal
              components of the 500 biggest publicly listed Norwegian companies.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              PCA is not a commonly known thing so I'll explain it here for
              readers next week. It is really worth knowing about because it is
              a really good way to make sense of high dimensional data.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              "What do I know about high dimensional data? Nothing in my life is
              ever more than 3-dimensional," you might be thinking for yourself
              at first. However, let me give you an example of a highly
              dimensional dataset you already know or have a feeling of many
              pieces of: The set of all world countries and their corresponding
              attributes such as latitude, longitude, GDP, population, climate,
              standard of living, employment rate, life expectancy, and many
              more.

            <p>In a table form it would look something like this:</p>

            <p>
              How would we plot these? We could do one plot of population on the
              x-axis and GDP on the other, or maybe even make a 3D plot of
              population on x, GDP on y, and climate on z. This way we can see
              if there are relationships between these factors, such as the fact
              that high populations correlate with GDP to a certain degree
              because we seem to have a row of countries in a certain line.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However, what if we wanted to just look at all of them at once?
              Unfortunately we can't. We would need an x-axis, y-axis, z-axis,
              and many more axes. No one can comprehend so many dimensions at
              once. However, we can project them using some clever linear
              algebra with regards to eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

              Understanding PCA Through Projection
            </h3>
            <p>
              Anyhow, if you don't want to dive into the mathematics, you can
              think of projecting 3 dimensions onto 2 dimensions like this:
              Imagine you have a child's toy of a mechanical model of the solar
              system hanging from the roof above the bed. Then you have a lamp
              in the room that casts a shadow from the 3D toy onto the wall.
              This is how we can think of projecting a higher dimension (3 in
              this case) onto a 2-dimensional plane.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              src="https://halvorhansen.no/imageDB/pca-toy.png"
              alt="PCA illustration"
              class="post-image"
            />
            <br />
            <p>
              But remember, we can still choose where to place the lamp. So to
              make things less arbitrary and more meaningful, for each dimension
              we reduce, we choose the angle that maximizes the spread of the
              objects on the wall. In this case with the orrery of the solar
              system, that would be somewhere from the side where all the
              planets are on roughly the same plane.
            </p>

              Principal Components and Explained Variance
            </h3>
            <p>
              In PCA analysis, we create new axes called principal components
              (PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.). PC1 is the direction that captures the most
              variance in the data. PC2 captures the second most variance and is
              perpendicular to PC1, and so on. The explained variance tells us
              how much of the total variation in our data is captured by each
              principal component.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For example, if PC1 has 45% explained variance, it means that this
              single axis captures 45% of all the variation in our
              multi-dimensional dataset. If PC2 has 25% explained variance, then
              together PC1 and PC2 capture 70% of the variation. This allows us
              to reduce many dimensions down to just 2 or 3 that we can actually
              visualize and understand, while still retaining most of the
              important information.

              Next week, I'll present the full PCA analysis of the 500 largest
              publicly listed Norwegian companies, showing which financial
              metrics drive the most variance in company performance and how
              companies cluster together in this reduced dimensional space.
