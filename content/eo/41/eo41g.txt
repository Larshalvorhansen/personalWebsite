To understand complex systems, it’s often helpful to approach them from multiple perspectives and levels of analysis. This principle applies to economics as well.

In economics, there are two primary approaches to understanding the allocation of limited resources. The first is a bottom-up perspective, which starts with individual components and builds upward. The second takes a top-down view, examining large entities such as entire countries as separate actors competing and cooperating for resources. One can also go beyond national boundaries and consider the world as a single economic entity. This week’s article explores this global perspective.

The structure of global trade is well-documented and publicly accessible through the OECD’s trade database, available at: https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/international-trade.html.

However, analyzing imports and exports doesn’t always provide a complete picture, as many products and services in a country are produced and consumed domestically by its citizens.

Below is an infographic highlighting the top industry in each country.

So, what is the benefit of global trade? The classic economic theory of comparative advantage suggests that countries can specialize in producing goods and services where they are most efficient, trading with others to mutual benefit.

Interestingly, we are now experiencing a counterintuitive trend toward a less globalized world, driven by factors such as protectionism and supply chain disruptions.

What does this shift mean for athe future of global economies?
