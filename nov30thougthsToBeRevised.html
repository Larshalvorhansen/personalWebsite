I remember when my teacher gave us a poem on a test or some exam or something of that sort. The poem was kind of meta. It was about how 

Takk til Lars Lundheim og Elsys. Det har gitt meg så mye frihet og et godt environment. Så godt og fritt at jeg nå kjenner meg selv veldig godt. Jeg har lært meg å tenke. 

Datamaskinen kan være et verktøy

Musikk er en slags mening med livet

Det er veldig underliggende effekter som spiller inn som gjør at menneskeheten er der vi er nå og de har med et lokalt maksimum i energi å gjøre. Caltech professor sier noe om meningen med livet at det kommer fra å utnytte en energi. 

Evolusjonsteorien til Darwin gjelder ikke bare for arter men også for religion. 

People dont have ideas, ideas have people. 

Den industrielle revolusjonenvar “inevitable”

Mennesker jobber når de har insentiver til å gjøre noe. Der er litt som en AI

Det er et dypt insentiv som (jeg tror) ligger under bevistheten.

Det er dette som egentlig driver oss. 

Einstein hadde et stort ønske om å bli anerkjent fysiker, men det var ikk edet som styrte tankene og kreativiteneten hans. Det er noe som ligger og lurker nederst i hjernern “under kreativitet” og det er kanskje basert på tilfeldigheter. 

Purely “ideas of genius” come from intuition. But they have to arise from luck in some sence.

For me life was good in ethiopia. I'm quite sure that it was because I could feel human connection in the way that Echart Tolle talks about it. 

“The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman”

An unreflected life is not worth living. This is probably a big driver of why its common to take gapyears. To “find yourself” etc. This type of idea i think stems from what Echart Tolle is talking about. 

I have considered getting into the music industry. Just because i LOVE music. But its 

Anyone saying to be creative or 

Maybe the biggest things most companies today are trying to to is peer as deep as possible into the brains of the person they are interviewing. Because any persons intentions can be hidden at any point. (1)

The biggest hinder for scientific progress today and i think a big sad fact about academia is precisely (1). 

(2)Progress is inevitable. To give an example “In any competitive environment for example in competing for money the “winner” is the agent that is willing to sacrifice ethics or some other good in order to obtain that money will get it”

Because of this phenomenon(2) human society is funadamentaly meritocratic in the sence that the best idea wins. This is obvius if we look at it from a technology perspective. Even North Korea (the most closed society known) uses and i predict will continue to adapt (for example) western ideas despite technological progression. Kim Young un will obviously use any existing, accessible and “aware of” technology to his own advantage. 

A big problem (area of potential improvement) (i at least) see for humanity facing global challenges fundamentally the ability for money and influence to be directed to the right people but more fundamentally the best ideas/technologies/engineers. 

Another big obstacle that I see (which is also quite obvious when thinking back on it) lies in the limits of language. An example I might highlight is that people choose what fields of work they want to go into, so for example which engineering degree they want to go into. They then end up at the end of their degree with a lingo specifically tied to a common concept within that field even though it is fundamentally based on the same idea as another subject. John Henry Holland illustrates this well in his talk about  ”the idea of boundaries”.

(sidenote i think the fact that Holland talks about very fundamental ideas, concepts and principles is the thing that makes it easy for him (his brain) to jump constantly between different subjects without much friction)

In regards to the progression of STEM and i guess human progress (progress here is ment as the extension of human ability ie. the “bending of the laws of physics”) would be to have an idea meritocracy between:

Human brains in the correct mental state
Menal state:
At uneze/with an internal longing for an outcome that is far enough down in consciousness so as to not be distracted by it
With as many relevant threads (things/ideas that could be connected) as available in the brain as possible(the best scenario would be the feeling of having something “on on the tongue”)
This could be achieved by having the brain be exposed to the concepts and ideas in a repeated fashion
The brain has to be in a fundamentally safe state. This for me atleast and probably for the rest of humans and maybe animals as well it comes down to social acceptance, feeling loved, being fed etc.
The brain will perform better and better the more it is aligned with the vision of the project and does not have (or get over time)
Access to tools at their fingertips.
